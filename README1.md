# Which API endpoint and why?

Two major reasons why I chose to use /services/alignment/similarity/{proteins}/{segments}/
      1. This helps me understand how the actual work is going to look like. Real work simulation.
      2. I have read few things about proteins in  human so was curious to know about it further.

# How to run the project locally?

1. Download the zip file and extract the elements in it.
   
2. Make sure you have d3 and axios installed if not you can use following commandds to install. 
    a. npm install d3
    b. npm install axios
   
3. Once you are all set npm start the react server by running - npm start

4. The application should open automatically in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000/. If it doesn't, open the URL manually.
